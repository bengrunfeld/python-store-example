# Python Store Example

* App needs to offer a User a menu.
* User should be able to choose “Create Product”, “List Products”, or “Exit Program”.
* If User chooses “Create Product”, they should be prompted for data. E.g New product name, new product price, etc.
* The product information the User inputted should be stored as a Dictionary, formatted as JSON and written to a local file.
* If User chooses “Product List”, App should read the contents of the JSON file, but only print the values to the screen
